      "0: '1. Introduction '\n",
      "1: 'A. Description: Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored when a player catches any legal pass in the end zone that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding the disc. The disc is advanced by passing it to other players. The disc may be passed in any direction. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of the team in possession of the disc. Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework governed by the principles of Spirit of the Game. '\n",
      "2: 'B. Rules Variations '\n",
      "3: '1. Appendices included in these rules outline rules changes and additions specific to several variations of the sport. '\n",
      "4: '2. Event Organizer Clause: The event organizer may modify rules relating to game logistics in order to suit the event. Examples include game length (game total), time limits (time caps), halftime length, number of timeouts, starting time point assessments, uniform requirements, and observer operations. Any such change must be established before competition starts. '\n",
      "5: '3. Captain's Clause: For games not subject to the event organizer clause, a game may be played under any variation of the rules agreed upon by the captains of the teams involved. Otherwise, any rules variations are subject to approval by the event organizer.  '\n",
      "6: 'C. General vs. Specific Rules: Many of these rules are general in nature and cover most situations. However, some rules cover specific situations and override the general case. '\n",
      "7: ''\n",
      "8: '2. Spirit of the Game '\n",
      "9: 'A. Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play. '\n",
      "10: 'B. All players are responsible for knowing, administering, and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. '\n",
      "11: 'C. It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists. '\n",
      "12: '1. If a player intentionally or flagrantly violates the rules, the captains of each team should discuss the incident and determine an appropriate outcome, and are not bound by any outcome dictated by these rules. '\n",
      "13: 'D. Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as officials in any arbitration between teams. Players must: '\n",
      "14: '1. know the rules; '\n",
      "15: '2. be fair-minded and objective; '\n",
      "16: '3. be truthful; '\n",
      "17: '4. explain their viewpoint clearly and concisely;  '\n",
      "18: '5. allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak; '\n",
      "19: '6. consider their opponent’s viewpoint; '\n",
      "20: '7. use respectful words and body language; '\n",
      "21: '8. resolve disputes as quickly as possible; '\n",
      "22: '9. make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game; and  '\n",
      "23: '10. only make a call where an infraction is significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the action or where a player’s safety is at risk. '\n",
      "24: '[[Players are required to “explain their viewpoint clearly and concisely” and “resolve disputes as quickly as possible.” As such, most discussions should not exceed thirty seconds before either reaching a resolution or requesting an observer to resolve the dispute. If both players have had an opportunity to state their viewpoint and it is clear that an agreement will not be reached, players have an obligation to accept that the call is contested and resolve it as such. Where a dispute exists regarding what a rule says, the players may agree to consult a rulebook.]] '\n",
      "25: 'E. The following are examples of possible actions to support good spirit: '\n",
      "26: '1. informing a teammate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary call, caused a foul or violation, or need a clarification of a rule; '\n",
      "27: '2. retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was necessary or believe that it was made in error and should not have been called; '\n",
      "28: '3. complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit; '\n",
      "29: '4. touching base with an opponent on the sideline after a contentious interaction; '\n",
      "30: '5. discussing and/or making calls about contact that could be considered a foul in order to keep players safe; '\n",
      "31: '6. introducing yourself to your opponent; and '\n",
      "32: '7. reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation. '\n",
      "33: 'F. The following actions are clear violations of the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided by all participants: '\n",
      "34: '1. reckless play or dangerously aggressive behavior; '\n",
      "35: '2. intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations; '\n",
      "36: '3. taunting or intimidating opposing players; '\n",
      "37: '4. disrespectful celebration after scoring; '\n",
      "38: '5. making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s calls or other actions; '\n",
      "39: '6. calling for a pass from an opponent; and '\n",
      "40: '7. other win-at-all-costs behavior. '\n",
      "41: 'G. Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must: '\n",
      "42: '1. take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and good spirit; '\n",
      "43: '2. discipline team members who display poor spirit; '\n",
      "44: '3. provide constructive feedback to other teams about what they are doing well and/or how to improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game; and '\n",
      "45: '4. be aware regarding the potential for implicit biases to impact play and Spirit of the Game. '\n",
      "46: 'a. Players and team leaders should acknowledge and recognize that the implementation of Spirit of the Game (SOTG) is susceptible to bias. Team leaders should be mindful of and encourage their teammates to be mindful of their own biases when considering and discussing interactions with, and impressions of, other teams as well as their own team. Understand that intent and impact are not the same. The intent of a person’s statement or gesture may be neutral or positive to them, but the impact of what they say or do may be harmful or hurtful to others. '\n",
      "47: 'H. In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of ignorance of the rules, experienced players are obliged to explain the infraction and clarify what should happen. '\n",
      "48: '1. Coaches should teach players to come to a resolution on their own. If asked during a dispute coaches may offer rules clarifications. Coaches may not make calls from the sideline nor offer their opinion on a play. After a dispute, and when the player is not playing, a coach may talk to their own player about the dispute and offer opinions and guidance. '\n",
      "49: 'I. Rules should be interpreted by the players directly involved in the play, or by players who had the best perspective on the play (3.A). Players may seek the perspective of sideline players to clarify the rules, and to assist in making the appropriate call. '\n",
      "50: 'J. Players are responsible for making all calls except where specific rules designate non-players to make calls. [[For example, offsides on the pull or when observers keep time.]] K. If after discussion players cannot agree, or it is unclear: '\n",
      "51: '1. what occurred in a play, or '\n",
      "52: '2. what would most likely have occurred in a play,  the disc is returned to the thrower. '\n",
      "53: ''\n",
      "54: '3. Definitions '\n",
      "55: 'A. Best perspective: The most complete view available by a player that includes the relative positions of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a play. On an unlined field, this may require sighting from one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs to a player. However, players may rely on the following sources as a component of best perspective: '\n",
      "56: '1. Players may seek the perspective of sideline players to clarify the rules and to assist players in making the appropriate call. Players may seek the perspective of coaches to clarify a rule, but not to assist in making the appropriate call. '\n",
      "57: 'a. Sideline players should not offer their perspective unless solicited by a player. However, a sideline player may offer perspective without being asked by a player if the perspective offered is to the detriment of the sideline player’s team. '\n",
      "58: '2. Players may review officially-designated video footage to assist in resolving a call where such footage is available. However, play may not be delayed to review video footage. [[For example, live instant replay in a stadium setting may be used by players to resolve a contested foul call. Players may not, however, request that a particular play be replayed on the screen. If, after reviewing the video, players still cannot agree, they should not delay the game to rewatch the play multiple times; instead, the play should be treated as a regular contested foul.]] If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the disc should revert to the thrower (in the case of in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with the receiver on the end zone line (in the case of goal/non-goal disputes). '\n",
      "59: 'B. Completed pass: Any catch that results in the team in possession of the disc retaining possession. Any pass that is not complete is incomplete. '\n",
      "60: 'C. Foul: Non-Incidental contact between opposing players (see 3.F for a definition of incidental contact). In general, the player initiating the contact has committed the foul. '\n",
      "61: 'D. Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground. '\n",
      "62: 'E. Guarding: A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within 10 feet of that offensive player and are reacting to that offensive player. [[A defender who turns away from an offensive player and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no longer guarding that offensive player.]] '\n",
      "63: 'F. Incidental contact: Contact between opposing players that does not affect continued play. [[For example, contact affects continued play if the contact knocks a player off-balance and interferes with their ability to continue cutting or playing defense.]] '\n",
      "64: 'G. Legal position: A position established by a marker that does not violate any of the provisions outlined in 15.B. [[This refers to legal marking position. In general, this means there is sufficient space between the marker and the thrower’s torso, the marker is not straddling the pivot, and the marker’s arms are not \"wrapping\" the thrower.]] '\n",
      "65: 'H. Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line segment between two field markers with the thickness of said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining markers. '\n",
      "66: 'I. Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a thrower's possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of the body in contact with that spot is the pivot. [[This is not a body part, but rather an infinitesimally small point on the body.]] J. Possession of the disc: Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc. '\n",
      "67: 'J. Possession of the disc: Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.'\n",
      "68: '1. Catching a pass is equivalent to establishing possession of that pass. '\n",
      "69: '2. If a player loses possession of a disc during movement related to a catch, the initial possession ends. [[A disc that touches the ground while in a player’s possession is not a turnover.]] '\n",
      "70: '3. A disc in a player's possession is considered part of that player. [[Thus, hitting the disc in a player’s possession is a foul]] '\n",
      "71: '4. The team whose player is in possession, or whose players may pick up the disc, is considered the team in possession. If the disc is in the air following a legal pass, the thrower's team is considered the team in possession. '\n",
      "72: 'K. Pull: The throw from one team to the other that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal. It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special provisions (Section 9.B). The player on the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals readiness is the puller. [[The pulling team may designate a new puller at any time before the pull.]] '\n",
      "73: 'L. Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at the beginning of the game or when the previous goal is scored and ends when the next goal is scored. '\n",
      "74: 'M. State of the disc: The nature of play at a particular moment during the game. There are three states of the disc: '\n",
      "75: '1. A disc is “in play” when players are allowed to move and play may proceed without the defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has possession of a disc in play, any offensive player may become the thrower by taking possession of the disc (14.A). Once a player has possession of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc (14.A.2) prior to attempting a pass (17.K). '\n",
      "76: '2. A disc is “live” when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must (1) establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the disc to the ground (14.B). '\n",
      "77: '3. A disc is “dead” when play has stopped and can continue only with a check (see 9.D). The disc is not subject to a turnover. A dead disc may change states to either live or in play after a check depending on the circumstances. '\n",
      "78: 'N. Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a stoppage of play occurs. [[Play-halting calls include \"foul,\" \"violation,\" \"pick,\" \"stall,\" etc.]] '\n",
      "79: 'O. Throw: A disc in flight following any throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the thrower losing contact with the disc. [[Generally, a non-spinning, falling disc is not \"in flight\" unless it is intentionally dropped.]] '\n",
      "80: '1. A pass is equivalent to a throw. '\n",
      "81: '2. An intentionally dropped disc is considered a thrown disc. '\n",
      "82: '3. The act of throwing is the motion that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing. '\n",
      "83: '4. A throw is only considered complete when an offensive player gains possession that is not otherwise negated. '\n",
      "84: '5. An offensive player in possession of, or who has most recently possessed, the disc, is the thrower. '\n",
      "85: 'P. Violation: Any infraction of the rules other than a foul. '\n",
      "86: 'Q. Roles '\n",
      "87: '1. Captain: A team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and has been designated to represent the team in decision-making on behalf of the team before, during, and after a game. '\n",
      "88: '2. Coach: A team member who has been officially recognized by event organizers to have met the requirements necessary for coaching, including but not limited to certification, screening, education, and registration. Coaches are permitted in areas where sideline players are allowed, during and between points, in accordance with event rules. Coaches are not permitted to make calls or contribute to the discussion or resolution of calls, except to clarify rules if requested. '\n",
      "89: '3. Defensive player/Defender: A player whose team is not in possession of the disc. A defensive player may not pick up a live disc or a disc in play or call for a pass from the thrower. '\n",
      "90: '4. Event organizer: The person(s) or entity organizing and responsible for a competition, whether it is a tournament, tournament series, league, single game, or other type of event. Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to competition rules, safety, event registration and event logistics. '\n",
      "91: '5. Event support staff: Event support staff are officially designated personnel assigned by the event organizers to cover a wide variety of positions and responsibilities associated with an event, including but not limited to medical staff, scorekeepers, security, media, field crew, and other paid or volunteer positions. Vendors, sponsors, and business partners may also be designated as event support staff by the event organizer. Event support staff do not have additional duties or permissions beyond those specifically assigned by the event organizer. '\n",
      "92: '6. Marker: The defensive player within ten feet of the thrower's pivot or of the thrower if no pivot has been established. If the disc is not in a player’s possession, a defensive player within ten feet of a spot on the field where the disc is to be put into play is considered the marker. '\n",
      "93: '7. Non-player: Any person who is not a player or sideline player as defined in these rules. '\n",
      "94: '8. Observer: Observers are non-player game officials whose job is to support the players in implementing a safe, fair, and efficient game. Observers carefully watch the action of the game, assist with communication, help uphold self-officiating and the Spirit of the Game, assist with resolving calls as needed, and perform other duties as described in Section 19. '\n",
      "95: '9. Offensive player: A player whose team is in possession of the disc. '\n",
      "96: '10. Player: One of the up to fourteen (14) persons who are participating in the current point of play. '\n",
      "97: '11. Sideline player: Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point. '\n",
      "98: '12. Spectator: Event attendees who do not fall into one of the other roles defined in 3.Q. '\n",
      "99: '13. Spirit captain: A team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and has been designated to address, discuss, and resolve spirit issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches, and game or event officials. If no spirit captain is designated, this role is assigned to the captain(s). '\n",
      "100: '14. Team member: Any person designated by the team, to the event organizer, to be officially associated with the team, per the rules established by the event organizer. '\n",
      "101: '15. Team support staff: A team member who has been officially recognized by event organizers to be a member of the team for a specific support purpose. Team support staff are generally permitted in areas where sideline players are allowed, but may be further restricted by event rules. '\n",
      "102: ''\n",
      "103: '4. Playing Field '\n",
      "104: 'A. The playing field is a rectangular area and should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable player safety. Well-trimmed grass is the recommended surface and all lines should be marked. '\n",
      "105: 'B. The standard field of play has dimensions as shown on the accompanying diagram (see Appendix A). '\n",
      "106: 'C. The playing field is bounded by four perimeter lines: two (2) sidelines along the length and two (2) backlines along the width. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field. '\n",
      "107: 'D. The playing field also includes two (2) goal lines parallel to the backlines. The two (2) areas bounded by each backline, the sidelines, and the nearest goal line are the end zones. '\n",
      "108: 'E. The central zone is the playing field excluding the end zones. [[Central zone was previously referred to as the playing field proper in previous editions of the rules.]]  '\n",
      "109: 'F. The goal lines separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central zone. '\n",
      "110: 'G. Brick marks are located in the central zone a set distance from each goal line and midway between the sidelines. Reverse brick marks are located in each end zone midway between the goal line and backline and midway between the sidelines. A midfield mark is located midway between the goal lines and midway between the sidelines. '\n",
      "111: 'H. The corners of the central zone and the end zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible cones or pylons. '\n",
      "112: 'I. It is recommended that the following additional lines are also established. '\n",
      "113: '1. The equipment line surrounds the playing field. Spectators and gear should remain behind this line to keep the perimeter safe and clear during play. '\n",
      "114: '2. The team lines are outside of the playing field, parallel to the sidelines. Competitors and coaches should remain behind these lines to allow play adjacent to the playing field. '\n",
      "115: 'J. If play is obstructed by competitors, coaches, spectators, or objects within five yards of the playing field, any obstructed player or the thrower in possession of the disc may call this violation. Play resumes at the stall count reached plus one, or 9 if over 8. '\n",
      "116: ''\n",
      "117: '5. Equipment '\n",
      "118: 'A. Any disc acceptable to both team captains may be used. If they cannot agree, the current Official Disc of USA Ultimate is used. '\n",
      "119: 'B. Players may wear any soft clothing that does not endanger the safety of other players or provide unfair advantage. '\n",
      "120: 'C. Cleats with dangerous parts, such as metallic baseball cleats, track spikes, or worn or broken studs with sharp edges, are not allowed. '\n",
      "121: 'D. Each player must wear a uniform or other clothing distinguishing that player from players on the other team. In tournament play, matching uniforms and numbered jerseys are recommended. '\n",
      "122: 'E. Players may not use clothing or equipment to unfairly inhibit or assist the movement of the disc or another player. '\n",
      "123: ''\n",
      "124: '6. Length of Game '\n",
      "125: 'A. The game total is the predetermined number of goals to win the game. A game is played until one team first reaches the game total.  '\n",
      "126: '1. A standard game has a game total of 15. '\n",
      "127: 'B. The halftime target is the number of goals necessary to first reach at least half of the game total. Halftime begins when one team's score first reaches the halftime target. [[In a game with a game total of 15, the halftime target will be 8.]] '\n",
      "128: '1. A standard halftime is 10 minutes. [[The receiving team should be properly positioned on the line, having signaled readiness by the end of halftime, at which time the defense will have 15 seconds to release the pull.]] '\n",
      "129: 'C. Time Caps '\n",
      "130: '1. The soft cap occurs once a predetermined time of play has elapsed. At the soft cap, play continues until the current scoring attempt is completed. If, after the current scoring attempt is completed, the game total has not yet been reached by one team, one is added to the higher score and the resulting number is the new game total. '\n",
      "131: '2. The hard cap is the ending of the game once a predetermined time of play has elapsed. At the hard cap, play continues until the current scoring attempt is completed. If, after the current scoring attempt is completed, the score is tied, play continues until one additional goal is scored. Otherwise, the game ends. The team with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner. '\n",
      "132: '3. The halftime cap occurs once a predetermined time of play has elapsed. At the halftime cap, play continues until the current scoring attempt is completed. If, after the current scoring attempt is completed, the halftime target has not yet been reached by one team, one is added to the higher score and the resulting number is the new halftime target.

      "134: '7. Timeouts '\n",
      "135: 'A. A timeout stops play and suspends time limit counts. '\n",
      "136: 'B. Team Timeout: Each team has two team timeouts per half in a standard game. '\n",
      "137: '1. A team timeout lasts 70 seconds. '\n",
      "138: '2. Any player may call a timeout after a goal is scored and before both teams have signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts between points are suspended for 70 seconds. A timeout may not be called between a re-pull call and the ensuing pull. '\n",
      "139: '3. After the pull, only a thrower with possession of the disc that has survived ground contact can call a timeout. The player must form a T with one hand and the disc, and should audibly say “timeout.” The timeout begins when the T is formed. The disc is then placed on the ground at the pivot spot. '\n",
      "140: '4. Restarting play after a timeout called by a thrower: '\n",
      "141: 'a. All players at the time of the timeout call must return to play unless an injury timeout also is called. '\n",
      "142: 'b. Each offensive player must establish a stationary position by the end of the timeout. Movement after this time and before the disc is checked into play is a violation. The defense has ninety seconds after the beginning of the timeout or up to twenty seconds after all offensive players have established their positions (whichever is longer) to check the disc into play. '\n",
      "143: 'c. The player who had possession of the disc when the team timeout was called restarts play with a check at the pivot spot, and the marker resumes the stall count with the word “stalling” followed by the last number uttered before the timeout plus one or 9 if over 8, however 15.A.4 applies. '\n",
      "144: 'd. If the time limits for the timeout are exceeded by one team, a player on the other team may announce “delay of game” and the player at the location the disc is to be put into play may self-check the disc into play without acknowledgment by the opposing team. In order to invoke this rule a player must give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds. '\n",
      "145: '5. If the disc is live or in play and the thrower attempts to call a timeout when the team in possession has no timeouts remaining, play is stopped. The marker resumes the stall count with the number last uttered before the call plus three (e.g. if the timeout was called after a stall count of two, play would resume on a stall count of five). If this results in a stall count of ten or above, this is a turnover. '\n",
      "146: 'C. Injury Timeout: A timeout called for a player injury. During an injury timeout, the health and safety of the injured player are of primary concern. '\n",

A team must have a minimum of two players and a maximum of seven players on the field in order to signal readiness. The pull occurs when the puller throws (3.K) the disc after signaling readiness. [[Players (3.Q.10) may not signal readiness until all of their other team members are clear of the field (9.C.3.a).]] '\n",

If the disc has been pulled and a team has more than seven (7) players or has the incorrect mixed personnel ratio, it is the responsibility of all players on the field to call violation as soon as they recognize it. [[This rule is one of the exceptions to 17.A, and this violation call is always appropriate under 2.D.10.]] '\n",

After correcting the violation, the other team chooses whether to restart the point using re-pull timings (9.C.5.a) or to restart play as if a team timeout had been called (7.B.4) with the stall count determined by the applicable violation resolution of 15.A.5.a. If both teams are in violation, the point should be restarted unless both teams agree to restart play as if a team timeout had been called. '\n",

If a violation of 9.B.3.a is called after a goal has been scored and prior to the ensuing pull, the other team may choose to nullify the goal and restart the point using re-pull timings (9.C.5.a).

      "219: 'a. After signaling readiness, players on the pulling team may move anywhere in their end zone, but their feet may not break the vertical plane of the goal line until the disc is released. '\n",
      "220: 'b. After signaling readiness, players on the receiving team must have one foot on the goal line that they are defending without changing location relative to one another. '\n",
      "221: 'c. After the disc is released, it is in play and any player may move in any direction. '\n",
      "222: 'd. If a player on the pulling team fails to maintain proper positioning before the pull, the receiving team may call “offsides” before gaining possession of the disc. If a player on the receiving team fails to maintain proper positioning before the pull, the pulling team may call “false start” before the receiving team gains possession of the disc. The offsides and false start calls do not stop play, and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply. [[A sideline player or coach who is leaving the playing field with urgency but is still on the playing field when the disc is released is not considered to be offsides or committing a false start. If a sideline player or coach on the playing field impedes a player from the other team, that is a separate violation.]] In games where observers are used, these calls can only be made by the observers. In games without observers, each team may send a designated sideline player to either goal line who has the ability to call “offsides” or “false start” or to offer their perspective on such a call. A contested offsides call results in a stoppage of play and a re-pull. [[To contest an offsides or false start call, a player on the contesting team must have perspective at least as good as the person making the call. If the call is made by a designated sideline player, only a similarly-positioned sideline player designated by the contesting team has equal or better perspective.]] '\n",

Play stops after the outcome of the pull is decided.  Play resumes in a similar manner as after a team timeout. The player with possession of the disc (or any player on the offensive team if no player has possession) takes the disc to the spot on the playing field where the disc is to be put into play (per 9.B.6-7).  Ten seconds after the player in possession reaches that location, each offensive player must establish a stationary position.  Movement after this time and before the disc is checked into play is a violation. The defense has twenty seconds after all offensive players have established their positions to check the disc into play. '\n",

      "229: 'a. If the disc initially hits and remains in-bounds, it is in play where it comes to rest or is stopped (17.F). '\n",
      "230: 'b. If the disc initially hits in-bounds and then becomes out-of-bounds before being touched by the receiving team, it is put into play at the spot on the central zone (i.e., excluding the end zones) nearest to where it first crossed the perimeter line to become out-of-bounds. '\n",
      "231: 'c. If the disc initially hits in-bounds and then becomes out-of-bounds after being touched by the receiving team, it is put into play at the spot on the playing field nearest to where it first crossed the perimeter line to become out-of-bounds. '\n",
      "232: 'd. If the disc initially hits an out-of-bounds area, the receiving team may put the disc into play: '\n",

      "236: 'b. the spot on the long axis of the central zone nearest to the spot determined by 10.H if “middle” was called. '\n",
      "237: '7. If the pull is caught on the playing field, the disc is in play where it was caught. If the disc is caught outside the playing field, the disc is put into play at the spot on the playing field nearest to where it was caught. '\n",
      "238: '8. If a player on the receiving team touches the pull before it hits the ground and the disc then hits the ground, it is considered a dropped disc (13.B) and results in a turnover. '\n",
      "239: '9. After a pull, whichever player takes possession of the disc must put it into play. If a player drops the disc while carrying it to the spot where it is to be put into play and it contacts the ground before the thrower regains possession, the other team gains possession of the disc at the spot on the central zone nearest to the drop. '\n",
      "240: '10. There is no stoppage of play when putting the pull into play. If the disc is to be put into play at a location other than where possession was gained, the disc is live and the thrower must touch the disc to the ground after establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot on the playing field before attempting a pass.

      "255: '6. In games where observers are used, the observers may monitor and call time violations as appropriate. The first instance of a time violation for each team will result in a warning. After a team has received its warning, any further time violations will result in assessment of a team timeout (and the resulting time extensions). If a team has no timeouts remaining, time violations are treated as follows: '\n",

When an in-bounds player in possession of the disc whose first ground contact will be completely within the end zone loses possession of the disc due to an uncontested foul, or lands out of the end zone due to an uncontested force-out foul (17.I.4.b.4), that player is awarded a goal.

Thus, “goal” may not be called if the player did not maintain possession through all ground contact related to the catch, nor may “goal” be called prior to completion of all ground contact related to the catch.]] Best practice is to announce “goal” and raise both hands vertically above the head. After a contested or retracted goal call, play must restart with a check and the call is deemed to have been made when the pass was caught.

[[For an out-of bounds disc that has come to rest on the central zone, the team becoming offense will have twenty seconds to put it into play.]] '\n",
      "325: 'a. If the disc is out of bounds and not reasonably retrievable quickly, a replacement disc may be introduced without a stoppage of play. The player retrieving the disc must first confirm with a player on the opposing team that the new disc is acceptable. The player putting the new disc into play must then raise the replacement disc above their head and announce “new disc” before putting the disc into play according to 10.H. '\n",
      "326: 'b. If the disc is in the end zone, after twenty seconds elapse, a defensive player within 10 feet of the disc may announce “disc in,” and then initiate and continue the stall count, but only if a defensive player has given audible warnings of twenty, ten and five seconds (the pre-stall).

'\n",
      "328: 'd. Non-playing members of the team on offense may assist in retrieving live discs outside the player and team lines (or, if no such lines exist, live discs in the out-of-bounds area). Such players cannot cause a turnover. Once a player obtains possession of the disc, they must carry the disc to a spot outside the team line (or, if no such line exists, at least three yards away from the playing field) before carrying it to the spot where it is to be put into play. '\n",
      "329: '5. If an offensive player unnecessarily delays putting the disc into play in violation of rule 20.B, a defender within ten feet of the spot the disc is to be put into play may issue a delay of game warning instead of calling a violation, by announcing “delay of game” and counting down from three to zero at intervals of at least one second to provide an opportunity for the offensive player to react to the warning. Play then continues as follows: '\n",

If the behavior in violation of rule 20.B is stopped before the full utterance of the word “zero,” the marker stops the count-down and may only initiate the stall count as usual, according to 15.A.2.

Another example would be to run downfield, leaving the disc for someone else to pick up. However, if a player is taking more time than reasonably necessary to put the disc into play by standing back from the disc, wandering around near the disc, or standing over the disc, continuing such behavior during the threesecond countdown will allow a marker to initiate the stall count under 14.A.5.]] '\n",

      "337: 'a. The interval between the first utterance of each number in the stall count must be at least one second. [[Thus, a legal count from one to ten will take a minimum of 9 seconds. It is legal to count at intervals greater than one second between numbers]] '\n",
      "338: 'b. All stall counts initiated, reinitiated or resumed after a stoppage of play must start with the word “stalling.” '\n",
      "339: 'c. If the count resets to one during a stoppage of play, it is considered a new count. '\n",

If the disc is thrown, play continues until the outcome of that pass is determined. A stall is not a violation and the Continuation Rule (17.C) does not apply. '\n",

The thrower may contest a stall call in the belief that the disc was released before the first utterance of the word “ten” or if the marker committed a fast count such that the thrower did not have a reasonable opportunity to call “fast count” before the first utterance of the word “ten.” If a stall is contested: '\n",
      "348: '1. If the pass was complete or 15.B.1.B applies, play stops, players return to their positions at the time of the throw, and possession reverts to the thrower. After a check, the marker resumes the stall count according to 15.A.5.b.3. '\n",
      "349: '2. If the pass was incomplete, it is a turnover; play stops and resumes with a check. '\n",

However, in limited situations for contested marking violation calls, when the marker diverts their attention away from marking while reasonably and quickly assessing the conditions to the thrower’s marking violation call, the marker could determine that play was affected. For example, the thrower calls straddle, and while the marker is looking at their feet to assess their marking position, the thrower completes a throw around the marker. If the marker subsequently contests the straddle because they assessed that they weren't committing a marking violation, they could claim that play was affected and the disc should be returned to the thrower.

If the pick did affect the play, the disc reverts to the thrower.]] For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby prevented from getting open for a pass, the play was affected; however, if the receiver would not have received a pass even without the foul, the play was not affected.

Offsetting infractions: If both offensive and defensive infractions occur simultaneously or the sequence cannot be determined, the resolution for this set of infractions is: the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check, with the count reached plus one or at six if over five.

Some contact is inevitable, but players have an affirmative obligation to make reasonable efforts to avoid contact.]] '\n",
      "436: '1. Dangerous Play. Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of or posing a significant risk of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior are considered “dangerous play” and are treated as a foul. The proper call in such circumstances is “dangerous play” and play stops. This rule is not superseded by any other rule. [[The following are non-exhaustive examples of dangerous play:  significantly colliding with a mostly stationary opponent, jumping into a group of mostly stationary players,  diving around or through a player that results in contact with a player’s back or legs, running without looking, when there is a likelihood of other players occupying the space into which the player is traveling,  jumping or otherwise leaving the ground where it is likely that a significant collision will result,  wild or uncontrolled throwing motions, initiating contact with a player’s head,  initiating contact with an airborne player’s lower body that prevents them from landing on their feet, and jumping right in front of a sprinting player in a manner where contact is unavoidable]] '\n",
      "437: 'a. Dangerous play is considered a foul regardless of whether or when the disc arrives or contact occurs. '\n",
      "438: '1. The vast majority of dangerous play will involve contact between players. However, contact is not required for a player to invoke this rule where there is reasonable certainty that contact would have occurred had the player not taken steps to avoid contact. [[A player is not required to hold their position and receive contact in order to call “dangerous play,” but the mere possibility of contact is insufficient to justify a call. Furthermore, if the offending player stops or changes their path such that contact would not have occurred, contact was not “reasonably certain.”]] '\n",
      "439: 'b. Resolution. If uncontested, a call of “dangerous play” is resolved as an analogous foul (e.g., if the call occurred while or immediately after the calling player was making a play on a disc in the air, it is treated as a Receiving Foul (17.I.4.b)). A player called for dangerous play may contest the call if they believe the call was incorrect (17.B). '\n",
      "440: '1. Dangerous play between a thrower and marker is treated as a throwing foul that affected the play, regardless of whether or when the disc is released or when contact occurs, unless the calling player determines otherwise. '\n",
      "441: '2. Dangerous play occurring when or immediately after the disc is in the air is treated as a receiving foul if either player involved is attempting a play on the disc. However, the calling player may elect to treat the dangerous play as a general foul, if the player determines that the dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play that decided the outcome of the action. [[For example, if a third player appears and grabs the disc far before it reaches the two involved players, or if the disc is thrown to the opposite side of the field, the involved players will not be attempting a play on the disc. However, if multiple players accumulate under a floating disc, one player’s dangerous play will be treated as a receiving foul, even if a third player happens to make a successful play on the disc, as the players under the disc were attempting a play on the disc. The calling player would have discretion to deem the third player’s play so independent and removed from the involved players that the calling player wishes to treat the dangerous play as a general foul rather than a receiving foul. In general, a calling player’s decision that a dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play will be based on the dangerous play being removed in significant distance or time from the overall play. By way of further example, even a dangerous play committed against a player unaware of the approaching disc will be treated as a receiving foul, where the offending player was attempting to make a play on the disc, giving the benefit of the doubt that the calling player could potentially have become aware of the approaching disc, had the offending player made a safe play. In this instance, the calling player could determine that it would not have been possible to become aware of the disc such that the outcome of the play would have changed and therefore elect to treat the dangerous play as a general foul.]] '\n",
      "442: '3. Dangerous play is treated as a general foul only if it occurs when the disc is not in the air, occurs far away from the disc, when the disc is obviously uncatchable, or when the calling player has elected such treatment under 17.I.1.b.2. In this situation, the calling player determines whether the play was affected, under the standard enunciated in this rule and its annotations. [[A disc is obviously uncatchable only when it hits the ground before a catch could possibly be made, is out-of-bounds with no possibility of an in-bounds completion, or otherwise presents no opportunity for a catch (whether initial or subsequent efforts), giving every benefit of the doubt to the calling player.]] [[In determining whether a dangerous play affected the play under 17.I.1.b.3, the calling player should broadly consider the entire play, including any approach taken by the offending player immediately before the dangerous play. A good rule of thumb is to look to the last time when a player could have still changed their actions and actively avoided a dangerous outcome but did not (the “point of no return”) through the time immediately after resolution of the play and broadly consider whether the outcome of the play could possibly have been different, had the offending player taken a safe approach. Even a player’s awareness of the presence of the offending player can affect the play.]] '\n",
      "443: '2. A foul can be called only by the fouled player and must be announced by loudly calling “foul” immediately after it occurs. '\n",
      "444: '3. Contact resulting from adjacent opposing players simultaneously vying for the same unoccupied position is not in itself a foul. '\n",
      "445: '4. Some fouls carry some extra provisions, as listed below. '\n",
      "446: 'a. Throwing Fouls: '\n",
      "447: '1. A throwing foul may be called when there is non-incidental contact between the thrower and marker. [[Nearly every instance of contact between the thrower and marker will be non-incidental with respect to the thrower, whether it disrupts the thrower’s concentration, interferes with the thrower’s movement, disturbs the thrower's grip, interferes with a throw, or affects continued play in any other way.]] The disc in a thrower's possession is considered part of the thrower. '\n",
      "448: '2. In general, any contact between the thrower and the extended (i.e., away from the midline of the body) arms or legs of a marker is a foul on the marker, unless the contacted area of the marker is completely stationary and in a legal position. [[Really completely stationary. This is very rare.]] '\n",
      "449: '3. Any contact that occurs due to the marker setting up in an illegal position (15.B.3) is a foul on the marker. [[Non-incidental contact. Again, nearly all contact will be nonincidental with respect to the thrower.]] [[This contact must be part of an ultimaterelated maneuver (throwing, pivoting, etc.) and must occur with a part of the marker that is illegally positioned. For example, shoving the marker does not result in contact due to the marker setting up an illegal position. Similarly, if a marker is providing disc space, except for illegally wrapping the thrower with their arms, only contact with the illegally positioned arms is due to the marker setting up an illegal position.]] Once the marker has set up in a legal marking position, it is the responsibility of both players to respect this legal position. However, contact resulting from the thrower and the marker both vying for the same unoccupied position is a foul on the marker. '\n",
      "450: '4. Any contact initiated by a thrower with the body (excluding arms and legs extended from the midline of the body) of a legally positioned (15.B.3) marker is a foul on the thrower. [[Non-incidental contact. The effect of the contact on the marker is important here, as many, but not all, instances of contact will affect continued play with respect to the marker.]] '\n",
      "451: '5. Although it should be avoided whenever possible, incidental contact occurring during the follow-through (after the disc is released) is not a foul. [[Remember, even if the contact were non-incidental, because it occurred after the throw was released, it cannot be deemed to have affected the specific play, and a turnover will stand.]] '\n",
      "452: '6. If non-incidental contact occurs between the thrower and marker such that the thrower could call a throwing foul on the marker, the thrower may instead choose to call “contact.” Play does not stop and the marker resumes the stall count at “one.” Other than resetting the stall count, the “contact” call is resolved in the same manner as a marking violation (15.B). The marker may contest the “contact” call by calling “violation,” which stops play. If the thrower calls “contact” after beginning the throwing motion and subsequently releases the disc, it is treated as if the thrower called “foul.” '\n",
      "453: '7. Any references above to a marker also apply to any defensive player within ten feet of the thrower's pivot. '\n",
      "454: 'b. Receiving Fouls: '\n",
      "455: '1. If a player contacts an opponent while the disc is in the air and thereby interferes with that opponent's attempt to make a play on the disc, that player has committed a receiving foul. Some amount of incidental contact before, during, or immediately after the attempt often is unavoidable and is not a foul. [[The opponent must at least begin an attempt to make a play on the disc. The opponent’s \"attempt to make a play on the disc\" includes any second efforts after a disc is tipped, if the disc has not become uncatchable.]][[Incidental contact, by definition, is not a foul.]] '\n",
      "456: '2. If 17.C.3.b.1 of the Continuation Rule applies: if the call is uncontested, the fouled player gains possession at the spot on the playing field closest to the spot of the infraction. If the foul is contested, the disc reverts to the thrower. '\n",
      "457: '3. The Principle of Verticality: All players have the right to enter the air space immediately above their torso to make a play on a thrown disc. If non-incidental contact occurs in the airspace immediately above a player before the outcome of the play is determined (e.g., before possession is gained or an incomplete pass is effected), it is a foul on the player entering the vertical space of the other player. [[If the disc is caught (or rendered uncatchable) before contact occurs, then the outcome of the play is determined already and the contact is not an infraction of this rule.]] '\n",
      "458: '4. Force-out Foul: If an airborne player catches the disc and is contacted by an opposing player before landing, and that contact causes the player to land out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds, or out of the end zone instead of in the end zone, it is a foul on the opposing player and the fouled player retains possession at the spot of the foul. If an uncontested force-out foul results in an in-bounds player landing outside the end zone being attacked when they would have landed in the end zone without the foul, a goal is awarded. '\n",
      "459: 'c. Blocking Fouls: '\n",
      "460: '1. When the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc and any resulting non-incidental contact is a foul on the blocking player which is treated like a receiving foul (17.I.4.b). [[Solely. The intent of the player’s movement can be partly motivated to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc, so long as it is part of a general effort to make a play on the disc. Note, if a trailing player runs into a player in front of them, it is nearly always a foul on the trailing player.]] '\n",
      "461: '2. A player may not take a position that is unavoidable by a moving opponent when time, distance, and line of sight are considered. [[If you are already in a position, you maintaining that position is not \"taking a position.\"]] Non-incidental contact resulting from taking such a position is a foul on the blocking player. '\n",
      "462: 'd. Strip: If a foul causes a player to lose possession of the disc, it is a strip. A strip is a subset of fouls and is treated the same way. [[Initiating contact with a disc in a player’s possession is a foul.]] [[Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc is required to establish possession (3.J). A player may not call a strip if they had only momentary contact with or lacked control of the disc at the time of an opponent contacting the disc because the player did not have possession.]] '\n",
      "463: 'J. Picks: '\n",
      "464: '1. A pick occurs whenever an offensive player moves in a manner that causes a defensive player guarding (3.E) an offensive player to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the obstructing player. '\n",
      "465: '2. A pick can be called only by the obstructed player and must be announced by loudly calling “pick” immediately after it occurs. [[Call the pick immediately. If you wait too long, you lose your window of opportunity to make the call.]] '\n",
      "466: '3. If play stops according to 17.C, players reposition according to 17.C.6. [[So if the disc is returned to the thrower, everyone resumes the locations they occupied at the earlier of the time of the throw or the time of the call.]] In addition, the obstructed player is then allowed to move to recover the relative position lost because of the pick. [[Then the picked defender catches up the relative position lost because of the pick. If they were trailing by 9 feet, then they get to catch back up to 9 feet away, but do not get to set up right next to the offensive player.]] '\n",
      "467: '4. During any stoppage, opposing players may agree to slightly adjust their locations to avoid potential imminent picks. '\n",
      "468: 'K. Traveling: The thrower must establish and continually maintain a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field until the throw is released. Failure to do so is a travel and is resolved according to 17.K.3, below. [[Resolved according to 17.K.3 only if the travel is called, otherwise play continues uninterrupted.]] '\n",
      "469: '1. In addition, each of the following is a travel: '\n",
      "470: 'a. A player catches the disc and either speeds up, changes direction or does not stop as quickly as possible before establishing a pivot (16.B). '\n",
      "471: 'b. A player receives a pass while running or jumping, and releases a pass after the third additional ground contact and before establishing a pivot (16.C). '\n",
      "472: 'c. Purposeful bobbling (including tipping, delaying, guiding, brushing, or the like) to oneself in order to advance the disc in any direction from where it initially was contacted (16.A). '\n",
      "473: '1. If a defender commits this infraction and the result of the play is a turnover, the defender retains possession at the initial spot of the travel. '\n",
      "474: 'd. The thrower fails to touch the disc to the ground when required (14.B). '\n",
      "475: '2. Exceptions: '\n",
      "476: 'a. If a non-standing player loses contact with the pivot spot in order to stand up, it is not a travel, provided the new pivot is established at the same location. '\n",
      "477: 'b. It is not a travel if a player catches the disc and releases a pass before three additional points of ground contact (16.C). '\n",
      "478: 'c. If play stops, the thrower may reset the pivot. '\n",
      "479: '3. Resolutions: '\n",
      "480: 'a. If the travel occurs and a pass is thrown: '\n",
      "481: '1. If the pass is incomplete, play continues uninterrupted (as per the Continuation Rule, 17.C.4.b). '\n",
      "482: '2. If the pass is complete, play stops and the disc is returned to the thrower where the travel occurred (as per the Continuation Rule, 17.C.4.a.1). Play restarts with a check. [[The spot where the travel occurred is the spot on the field where the thrower’s pivot would have been had they not traveled.]] [[If the thrower threw from either the end zone or out-of-bounds, and their pivot was more than one step from the appropriate spot, the following procedure is used instead: First, the disc is checked in where the thrower threw the pass, making it live, then the thrower walks to the appropriate spot for their pivot and puts the disc in play. At this point, the stall count may resume.]] '\n",
      "483: 'b. If the travel occurs and no pass has been attempted: '\n",
      "484: '1. Play does not stop. The defense (typically the marker) points to the spot where the travel occurred, and the thrower returns to that spot without delay. The thrower must touch the disc to the ground before attempting a legal pass. [[Play does not stop, but the disc is live, so it is still subject to a turnover (for example if the thrower drops it).]] '\n",
      "485: '2. The stall count is paused until the thrower sets a pivot where the travel occurred. The marker is not required to say “stalling” when resuming the count if they previously initiated the stall count by saying “stalling” prior to calling travel. The thrower must touch the disc to the ground before attempting a pass. [[The marker must initiate a stall count with the word “stalling,” but resuming the count does not require the marker to say “stalling” again because play did not stop.]] '\n",
      "486: '3. If the thrower wishes to contest the travel call, they announce “violation” and play stops. Upon checking the disc in, the stall count resumes at the count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5 (15.A.5.a.3). [[If the defense does not indicate to the thrower where the travel occurred, or the thrower wishes to contest the location of an indicated spot, the thrower should announce “violation”, stopping play, and explain that the spot was incorrectly/not indicated.

      "487: 'L. A player's ability to catch or make a play on the disc is not considered to be “affected” because that player stopped, slowed down, or otherwise ceased to continue playing because a call was made by another player. Players are encouraged to make every effort to continue playing until play actually stops.

      "491: 'B. A player who jumps is entitled to land at the take-off spot without hindrance by opponents. That player also is entitled to land at another spot, provided that the landing spot, and the direct path between the take-off and landing spots, were not already occupied at the time of take-off. [[This does not trump a player’s responsibility to make reasonable efforts to avoid contact and to not commit a blocking foul.

       "[' (Note): Preface: Ultimate is a sport that inspires players and fans alike because of its ability to develop and showcase the athleticism, skill, teamwork, and character of its participants. The arc of the disc in flight, the opportunity for each individual to contribute equally to their team’s success, and the trust given to each player to know and uphold the rules make ultimate a sport that is embraced for its fun and excitement on the field and for the community beyond it. As a low-cost sport requiring minimal equipment, offering single and mixed-gender play, and providing a format that builds communication and conflict resolution skills, ultimate provides a welcoming, high value experience for players and fans from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. The Official Rules of Ultimate 2022-2023 describes how the game is played, including how players self-officiate and apply the principles of Spirit of the Game in competition.',\n",
       " ' (Note): ',\n",
       " '1: Introduction',\n",
       " '1.A: Description: Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored when a player catches any legal pass in the end zone that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding the disc. The disc is advanced by passing it to other players. The disc may be passed in any direction. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of the team in possession of the disc. Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework governed by the principles of Spirit of the Game.',\n",
       " '1.B: Rules Variations',\n",
       " '1.B.1: Appendices included in these rules outline rules changes and additions specific to several variations of the sport.',\n",
       " '1.B.2: Event Organizer Clause: The event organizer may modify rules relating to game logistics in order to suit the event. Examples include game length (game total), time limits (time caps), halftime length, number of timeouts, starting time point assessments, uniform requirements, and observer operations. Any such change must be established before competition starts.',\n",
       " \"1.B.3: Captain's Clause: For games not subject to the event organizer clause, a game may be played under any variation of the rules agreed upon by the captains of the teams involved. Otherwise, any rules variations are subject to approval by the event organizer.\",\n",

       " '2: Spirit of the Game',\n",

       " \"2.B: All players are responsible for knowing, administering, and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount.\",\n",
       " '2.C: It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.',\n",
       " '2.C.1: \\tIf a player intentionally or flagrantly violates the rules, the captains of each team should discuss the incident and determine an appropriate outcome, and are not bound by any outcome dictated by these rules.',\n",

Team leaders should be mindful of and encourage their teammates to be mindful of their own biases when considering and discussing interactions with, and impressions of, other teams as well as their own team. Understand that intent and impact are not the same.
